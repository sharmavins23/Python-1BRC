# Pythonic 1 Billion Row Challenge

This mini-project is a personal challenge in optimization problems. The
challenge is adapted from its
[original form](https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/) (in
Java) by [Gunnar Morling](https://github.com/gunnarmorling).

The premise is simple - In `/data/`, a sample of ~44,000 weather stations exist.
From this initial data, 1 billion rows of a CSV are created of the following
sample structure:

```
Hamburg;12.0
Bulawayo;8.9
Palembang;38.8
St. John's;15.2
Cracow;12.6
...
```

The program should save and return the minimum, mean, and maximal values per
station, ordered alphabetically. For simplicity's sake, I've created generation
functions as well as standardized the output to CSV for comparison's sake.
